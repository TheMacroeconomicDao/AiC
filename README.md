# AiC (Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Community)

AiC (Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Community) is a project whose goal is to create an open community that will develop and use artificial intelligence models in the blockchain environment. AiC plans to use DAO contracts to regulate the operation of the models and ensure transparency and openness in the development and use of the AI models we create.

The problem that AiC solves is that the development and use of artificial intelligence models can be costly and complex, requiring significant resources and expertise. In addition, the use of models in different fields can raise concerns about privacy and security.

AiC proposes a solution to this problem by creating an open community where participants can collaboratively develop and use artificial intelligence models in the blockchain environment. The use of DAO contracts allows for transparency and openness in the process, as well as regulation of the operation of the artificial intelligence models.

The advantages of AiC lie in the fact that this open community allows participants to exchange knowledge and experience, as well as create and use artificial intelligence models in the blockchain environment with minimal costs. Additionally, the use of DAO contracts enables security and transparency in the process.

AiC can be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, such as creating artificial intelligence models in the fields of medicine, finance, transportation, and others.

We are building a platform where participants can jointly create and use artificial intelligence models in the blockchain environment, which will help improve the efficiency of using these technologies and make them accessible to a wider audience.

AiC is an open community engaged in research and development of artificial intelligence models in the blockchain environment. We actively study and use all available libraries and frameworks for AI model development.

We use various programming languages for developing our AI models, such as Python, C++, Java, and others.

To create high-quality AI models, we use the most popular libraries and frameworks, including:

TensorFlow: a popular deep learning framework developed by Google, used for creating and training various AI models, including neural networks.
PyTorch: another deep learning framework widely used for creating AI models, developed by Facebook and featuring a convenient interface for working with graphic processing units (GPUs).
Keras: a high-level API for creating and training neural networks, which can be used with TensorFlow and other deep learning frameworks.
Scikit-learn: a machine learning library containing various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.
OpenCV: a computer vision library used for image and video processing.
In addition, we actively study and use various machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and more.

Our team also utilizes blockchain technology to create decentralized AI models that can be run on the blockchain and used in various applications.

AiC utilizes DAO contracts to regulate the operation of our artificial intelligence models. DAO contracts enable network participants to make decisions about the development and use of AI models and regulate the distribution of rewards among participants.

Our community is also actively exploring the possibilities of using machine learning technology to improve the functioning of blockchain networks and increase the efficiency of decentralized applications.

Thanks to our open approach and use of AGPL licenses, we allow the wider community to contribute to the development and improvement of our AI models. We are confident that the joint efforts of community members will help us achieve great heights in the development of AI and blockchain technologies.

In the project, we use various blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, and others. These platforms provide us with the opportunity to create decentralized applications and smart contracts that can be used to regulate the operation of our artificial intelligence models.

Our team is also exploring the possibilities of using new technologies and tools, as well as integrating with other blockchain platforms and programming languages to improve the efficiency of our AI models.

We are convinced that using these tools and technologies will allow us to create higher quality AI models and solve complex problems in various industries.

In a world where AI is becoming an increasingly important element of our lives, developers must be at the forefront of developing this technology. We urge all developers, from juniors to the most experienced, to join our community, which is developing AI for the benefit of society.
